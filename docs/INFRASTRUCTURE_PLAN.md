# THE INFRASTRUCTURE  PLAN #

#FOLLOW THIS Claude Fullstack Repo Infrastructure 8 STEP PLAN TO PREPARE or CHECK THE INFRASTRUCTURE
-----------------------------------------------------


‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT** ‚ö†Ô∏è  
This file defines the **mandatory 8-step process** to prepare the repo infrastructure.  

- Every coding assistant must follow these steps **in order**.  
- Do **not** build product features until this setup is 100% complete.  
- Human + AI contributors should mark checklists as progress is made.  
- Refer also to `BASELINE.md` (at repo root) for the minimum hygiene checklist.  
- Ensure this plan is aligned with /docs/PRODUCT_BRIEF.md.

# üöÄ Claude Fullstack Repo Prep ‚Äì Optimized 8 Step Plan

The goal: build an extensive frontend + backend scaffold so Claude Code only has to finish ~20% of the work.  
Each step must be **completed** before advancing (this is important).  
You are building only the **infrastructure of the application**, not the application itself.  

---

## STEP 1 ‚Äî Build the Rich Infrastructure

Create a **deep scaffold** for both frontend and backend so Claude can recognize the architecture immediately.

**Tasks**
- Build a **frontend app shell** with routing, placeholder pages, components, and styling setup.  
- Build a **backend app shell** with API structure, health endpoint, and config in place.  
- Include `REPO_MAP.md`, `API_SPEC.md`, and a draft `CLAUDE.md` in the `docs/` folder.  
- Add **TODO markers and folder-level `_INSTRUCTIONS.md`** files so Claude knows where to add logic.  
- Add **root workspace** files: `pnpm-workspace.yaml` (or npm workspaces).  
- Add **containers/dev env**: `Dockerfile` (FE+BE), `docker-compose.yml`, `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`.  
- Add **editor baseline configs**: `.editorconfig`, `.gitattributes`, `.nvmrc`.  
- Add **`BASELINE.md`** at the repo root (Claude-ready hygiene checklist).  

**Deliverables**
- Frontend + backend app shells in place  
- Draft docs created in `docs/`  
- `_INSTRUCTIONS.md` stubs added  
- Workspace + Docker + devcontainer set up  
- Editor configs committed  
- `BASELINE.md` added at root  

**Checklist**
- [ ] Frontend scaffold built  
- [ ] Backend scaffold built  
- [ ] Docs folder created with drafts  
- [ ] Docs folder MUST Include `REPO_MAP.md`, `API_SPEC.md`, and a draft `CLAUDE.md` if it's not already there
- [ ] TODO markers and `_INSTRUCTIONS.md` stubs in place  
- [ ] Workspaces configured at root  
- [ ] Devcontainer runs `pnpm i && pnpm dev`  
- [ ] Docker compose brings up `web`, `api`, `db`  
- [ ] `BASELINE.md` present at root

## STEP 2 ‚Äî Enrich the Scaffold

If the repo looks shallow, enrich it so Claude needs fewer leaps of imagination.  

**Tasks**
- Add sample frontend routes/components: `/`, `/about`, `/dashboard`  
- Add domain model stubs and types/interfaces  
- Add mock data + fixtures for UI flows  
- Add `README_FRONTEND.md` and `README_BACKEND.md` with run instructions  
- Add `_INSTRUCTIONS.md` files with `CLAUDE_TASK:` markers  
- Add shared **types/contracts** in `packages/types`  
- Add backend API schema (`openapi.yaml`) + mock server script  
- Add DB seed + fixture data  

**Checklist**
- [ ] At least 2‚Äì3 sample routes/pages exist  
- [ ] Domain types/interfaces stubbed out  
- [ ] Mock data + fixtures included  
- [ ] README_FRONTEND.md and README_BACKEND.md added  
- [ ] Each folder has `_INSTRUCTIONS.md`  
- [ ] Shared `packages/types` added  
- [ ] API schema produced and mock server runs

## STEP 3 ‚Äî Audit for Alignment

Check that the scaffold matches the **product brief, tech specs, and UX goals**.  

**Tasks**
- Ensure navigation/pages reflect product flows

**Checklist**
- [ ] Navigation matches product journeys  
- [ ] Components/pages map to required features
